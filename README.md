# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Avantika

Iâ€™m learning **Python** and building a solid foundation in **AI and Machine Learning**.  
Right now, Iâ€™m focused on understanding concepts step by step through **CodÃ©dex** (My Buddy on this long Joureny:D) and creating small, practical projects along the way.

Iâ€™m curious about technology and enjoy building tools that can help people in real life, especially women.
